# My Operating System
 This was an upper-level project where the goal was to design your own operating system using UNIX principles in C.

 The shell supports all simple UNIX commands and the built-in commands cd and exit. Commands can be run in the background using the '&' sign. The shell can run in batch mode if the user invokes the shell with the file name as a command line argument. If there is no argument, the shell runs in ordinary interactive mode. It supports a command history, that can be displayed by executing the command 'history', and the user can cycle through previous commands using the up and down arrow keys. Input redirection with '<' and output redirection with either '>' or '>>' is allowed. Input and output redirection can be specified in the same command in either order. Commands with a single pipe are also permitted.

 All .c files are used for the shell, while the octopus.txt file is used for testing grep and text redirection.
